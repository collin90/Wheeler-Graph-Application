HOW TO RUN THIS APP IN YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER!!!

    A) Run these commands in your terminal
       1.  pip install virtualenv
       2.  virtualenv env
       3.  source env/Scripts/activate     ** it might be env/bin/activate if you get an error. You should see (env) as the output on your terminal **
       4.  pip install flask flask_cors
       5.  python algorithms/main.py    **this should launch a dev server for the python file (which doesn't do much yet, but it will!) If you go to this localhost url, it will show a 404 error. That's because the page does nothing by itself, it only has a callable method.**

    *Now, go to a new terminal and do the remaining commands to launch the actual app

       6.  yarn install
       7.  yarn dev

    B) Open up the app and navigate to the "VISUALIZE tab"

    C) click the 'run python' button and verify that the screen looks like this:

        nodes: 123
        edges: xyz
