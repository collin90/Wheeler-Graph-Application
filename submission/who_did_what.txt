This project was largely spearheaded by Collin; he did most of the managing of the project and set up the server
 and project structure. Joanna did the website front page as well as the structure of the tutorial page. Joanna
 and Julia split the content for the tutorial page. For the graphs on the front page and the tutorial page, either
 Collin provided the graphs, or Joanna and Julia based the graph on his work. Julia did the algorithm to convert the
 OILC data to a graph.  Brandon handled the algorithms for verifying the Wheeler property, finding the ordering
 (in both Python and OCaml), and wrote all unit tests. Other algorithms (e.g. Wheeler graphs from strings, OILC,
 and pattern matching) were written by Collin.
